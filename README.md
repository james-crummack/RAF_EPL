# RAF_EPL
A project to try and introduce a new metric to analyse the bias or (Ref Adjusted Factor) in the analysis of EPL matches.


## üìä Dataset: Mock Referee RAF

This dataset simulates 200 football matches and is designed to test models involving referee behavior, VAR impact, and Referee Adjustment Factor (RAF) calculations in football analytics.

### üîç Use Cases

This mock dataset is ideal for:
- Calculating **Referee Adjustment Factor (RAF)** and **Ref-Team Bias Index (RTBI)**
- Modeling **referee influence** on expected goals, penalties, or match outcomes
- Running **SHAP analysis** for feature importance and interpretability
- Generating **radar charts** or bias heatmaps for referee profiles

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This dataset is synthetic and created for experimental or educational purposes only. It does not reflect real-world match outcomes or refereeing behavior.
